# To Do

Some notes on updates going forward

---

## Display / CSS

*	Make the scoreboard display look like a scoreboard. Black background, yellow font.
*	Use a scoreboard-esque font. Maybe Google Webfonts - Press Start 2P
*	Need a seperator ("-" or ":") on the scores.

---

## Functionality

*	Admin page should display score
*	Should be able to keep track of sets
	*	Display set count on board
	*	Should be able to reset score without resetting sets
*	Should be able to enter a winning score value (e.g. 11). When a player reaches that score the big board will say "#{Player's Name} Wins!" and increment there set count.

## Record Keeping

Long term, it might be interesting to use a database or JSON file to track users and look at overall win / loss.
